# Memento Time Travel service logo (unofficial)

I needed a higher resolution version of the [Memento Time Travel service logo](http://mementoweb.org/static/css/images/timetravel_logo.png) for a presentation. One was not listed on the [MementoWeb logos page](http://mementoweb.org/tools/logo/), so I scaled up the available version and traced it in Adobe Photoshop CS6. There are probably better approaches to accomplish this like:

1. Requesting the original logo from the mementoweb.org authors.
2. Creating the logo in SVG to be infinitely more scaleable.
3. ???

...but these would take longer and I needed a higher resolution at that moment, so here we are. CC0 license in the spirit of the original logos.
